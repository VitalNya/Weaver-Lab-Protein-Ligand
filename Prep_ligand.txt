Load your ligand:

+ Go to File → Read Molecule

+ Load your ligand file (e.g., ligand.pdb or .mol2)

Assign charges and check structure:

+ Edit → Hydrogens → add → Add Polar Only

+ Edit → Charges → Compute Gasteiger

+ Edit → Detect Root

+ Ligand → Torsion Tree → Detect Root

Review rotatable bonds:

+ After detecting torsions, ADT will mark rotatable bonds in green.

+ You can interactively lock/unlock torsions by clicking on bonds in the viewer.

Save your ligand in .pdbqt format (required for Vina):

+ File → Save → Write PDBQT
