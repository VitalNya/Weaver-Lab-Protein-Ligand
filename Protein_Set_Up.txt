Protein Set Up

+ Set path (file -> 

+ Remove water molecules (edit -> delete water)
+ Remove any other unwanted molecules

+ Check and repair miss atoms (may receive error message, close Auto Dock vina and restart steps)
	(edit-> misc -> check for missing atoms -> select all residues-> dismiss) 
	(edit -> misc -> repair missing atoms ->
	*once done a window will pop up -> save as 2 sets -> dismiss)

+ App polar charges
	(edit -> charges -> add Kollman charges)
+ Check if charges have been distributed evenly (repeat till you get a warning screen saying "no residues with  non-integral charges found")
	(edit -> charges -> check total on residues-> ** if not diffused evenly ** spread charge deficit over all atoms in residue)
